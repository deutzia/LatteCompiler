Compilation is done using stack, which is wrapped around cabal. Used versions
of lexing and parsing tools were:
* stack 2.3.3
* cabal 3.0.0.0 compiled using version 3.0.1.0 of the Cabal library
* bnfc 2.8
* Alex version 3.2.5
* Happy Version 1.19.12

Autogenerated files are located in src/Parsing.

I made some assumptions about the exact semantics of the language that were
underspecified.

Returns: `return void` is allowed in a function returning void.
`return`, `while (true)` or `error` are instructions that are considered to be
sufficient to mark function as returning the correct type (even though in two
cases it never returns).

Classes: accessing fields and methods from methods of the class is possible both
without a modifier and using `self`.
